<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Enter content..."} -->
<p>We are so proud of our membership, who saw the need to intervene in this political moment and took a chance by endorsing a presidential candidate for the first time in our organization’s history. <strong>We knocked on thousands of doors, made over 100,000 phone calls in every major city in Florida and talked to our communities about the things we all deserve:</strong> healthcare, education, debt relief, higher wages, and a re-shaping of our criminal legal and immigration systems. And today, at the end of our efforts in our home state, we have more members and relationships than we’ve ever had because of this work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"className":"is-style-epic"} -->
<h3 class="is-style-epic"><strong>We are Florida kids. </strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>We know intimately the challenges that come with living in this huge peninsula.</strong> Metropolitan and rural and small town America, southern and international, deep and rich history interlaced with some of the worst horrors this country has ever committed. And in our lifetimes, we have lived through Trayvon and we lived through the tragic killings of 17 children at Marjory Stoneman Douglas. <strong>Florida is a hard place, but we birth movement and power out of tragedy.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We didn’t get the big shiny win last night, but exit polls tell us the majority of Floridians now support medicare for all. In 2018, a majority of voters decided to restore the voting rights of 1.4 million people with felonies. And nearly 400,000 Floridians voted for the candidate with the most progressive platform we’ve ever seen. <strong>Florida is moving, we’re busting our asses to make it happen.</strong></p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-chonk"><blockquote><p><strong>Florida is a hard place, but we birth movement and power out of tragedy.</strong></p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While we fight for progress in the state that is often the butt of jokes, our government fights us at every turn. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The GOP fought tooth and nail to gut Amendment 4, to the point that many people with felonies don’t know whether or not they can vote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as we sit in the midst of a global pandemic, with projections saying that millions of people could die, Florida’s government stood by and did nothing to ensure people could access the ballot and stay safe while doing so. Hundreds of polling sites were shutdown across the state. Thousands of students who were registered to vote had to move off campus when schools shut down, and then couldn’t change their address to vote in the counties where they wound up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4,"className":"is-style-epic"} -->
<h4 class="is-style-epic"><strong>In the face of all this, we moved quickly to take action, doing our best to meet our communities needs in the face of a whole lot of confusion.</strong> </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We cancelled canvasses and took to the phones instead. We’re setting up community health programs across the state to make sure our communities are. safe. We filed a lawsuit with the state, demanding they ensure every voter had access to vote by mail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Florida’s government has done nothing. Voters across the state yesterday shared that polling sites were empty. In our phone banks, voters told us they were sick and didn’t want to vote and get others sick or were worried they might catch something if they left the house. Our politicians could have ensured every voter had access to vote by mail in the wake of the crisis but they chose to ignore the problem. But again, they chose to do nothing instead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>We could live in a society that ensures everyone’s voice is heard. Florida politicians have made it clear that when we all have a voice, their power over us is threatened.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The road ahead is unclear. We may be entering very dark days. The face of community organizing is changing, but we commit to continuing the fight for our people. With business shutdowns, layoffs, job uncertainty, a slow moving congress and dim witted President we know meeting people’s needs is our greatest priority. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4,"className":"is-style-epic"} -->
<h4 class="is-style-epic">Now more than ever, all of us must show up for each other and remember the rallying cry that brought us all together: Not Me, Us.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this moment it will be young Black and Brown folks; young, disillusioned and angry folks; young, ordinary people across the country, in organization and unity who will remake the world. <a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/r-p7cUAcvkGKhwIyt1qDhg2">And we want you to join us.</a></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the last few days Evo Morales, the first Indigenous president in Bolivian history, and as our comrades at The Red Nation explain — ‘<a href="https://therednation.org/2019/11/11/thisisacoup-nocoupinbolivia/">the standard bearer of generations of Indigenous socialists</a>’ has been forced to flee his own country as right-wing militia and police round up Indigenous and leftist organizers, burn the Wiphala Indigenous flag, and violently attack supporters of Morales’ political party: the Movement Toward Socialism. Let us be clear: <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/11/greg-grandin-bolivia-evo-morales-coup-latin-america?fbclid=IwAR3svo1p7Xu-bSVKfi-pD52I6il18Rpr72XHARiwgHSomEe1TEMoq3OSRyE">this is a coup.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In October Morales won 47% of the popular vote in a democratic election. There has been little to <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2019/11/11/evo_morales_bolivia_protests_military_coup">no meaningful evidence to support that the elections were fraudulent</a>, though organizations in service of US imperial interests, notably the Organization of American States have claimed there were voting irregularities. To put this into perspective, Donald Trump won 46% of the popular vote in the United States, with <a href="https://newrepublic.com/minutes/145387/underplayed-story-2016-election-voter-suppression">thousands of instances of voter suppression</a>, and barriers to fair and free elections — the United States does not demonstrate pristine elections to anyone. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet the United States polices, bullies, and undermines other countries, particularly Black and brown nations that dare to elect socialists, with claims that these leaders are forcing their way into power, with or without any evidence to back it up. This is a recurring tactic in a long history of the United States intervening and <a href="https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/before-venezuela-the-long-history-of-u-s-intervention-in-latin-america/">destabilizing countries all over the world</a> to serve their own interests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>With so much competing information available online, and so many voices in a chaotic global context it can be confusing to know how and why we demonstrate solidarity with particular groups, even disagreeing with some who are part of the Bolivian diaspora.</strong> As young people committed to challenging capitalism, and the immense misery and violence that capitalism has caused in our lives and in our communities, we are deeply inspired and moved by what the Movement Toward Socialism has accomplished:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- /wp:tinypixel/post-container -->

<!-- wp:tinypixel/container -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Since coming to power in 2006 Evo Morales and his political party Movement Toward Socialism have been able to lift an enormous segment of the population out of poverty, establish a universal healthcare system, advance literacy and life expectancy, and ensure that thousands of women in Bolivia receive land tenure.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main opposition to President Evo Morales comes from <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/12/after-morales-ousted-coup-lithium-question-looms-large-bolivia">foreign corporations that want to mine and control Bolivia’s natural resources for their own profits</a>. Along with this opposition, there is a local dangerous fascist segment that wants to subjugate the Indigenous people of Bolivia. Evo Morales, an Indigenous socialist leader, represents the people’s defense of Pachamama and the self-determination of Bolivia’s Indigenous people. His presidency has long been a thorn in the side of the imperialists and big monopoly capitalists.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We do not have all the answers, and we do not need to have all the answers to take an explicit position against the rise of right-wing fascism spreading all over the world from Brazil to India to Israel to Bolivia. We do not need to be experts in the nuances and contradictions of every single regime in order to love the people, to believe in peoples struggles for advancing toward the liberated world we seek, and unequivocally vocalizing our solidarity. We recognize the greatest threat to our lives globally is clear and present: the wealthy ruling class and the increasingly fanatical militarized violence they are using to smash opposition from young people, Indigenous people, working people, and migrants.</p>

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jeanine Añez has proclaimed herself interim president of Bolivia, making the announcement while holding a large bible, even though she failed to get the required quorum in the senate to do so. From socialist Indigenous scholar and organizer Nick Estes: “Next to her stood Luis Fernando Camacho, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/what-the-coup-against-evo-morales-means-to-indigenous-people-like-me">a member of the Christian far-right</a>. <strong>After Evo’s resignation, Camacho stormed the presidential palace, a flag in one hand and a bible in the other.</strong> “The bible is returning to the government palace,” Camacho announced in front a camera while bowing before a bible and flag that he placed atop the presidential seal. “Pachamama will never return. Today Christ is returning to the Government Palace. Bolivia is for Christ.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile Indigenous socialists in Bolivia and the labor movement have mobilized throughout the country, refusing to back down to the coup led by corporate interests and the Union Juvenil Cruceñista, a right wing separatist militia.<strong> We see them. We trust them.</strong> We trust our comrades internationally who have shared <a href="https://nacla.org/news/2019/11/13/nacla-statement-coup-bolivia-solidarity-bolivians-resisting-military-intervention">letters</a>, essays, and <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-bolivian-crisis/article29955152.ece">articles</a> in solidarity with President Evo Morales and the Movement Toward Socialism. In times of crisis we look to the folks who have dedicated their lives to studying and supporting peoples struggles from below. So long as the people, anywhere in the world, are fighting for true democracy — control over the fruit of our labor, control over our bodily autonomy, and the right to live in our full dignity outside of and away from the tyranny of capitalism and empire, we will fight alongside of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As our comrade Vijay Prashad shared in <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-bolivian-crisis/article29955152.ece">a recent article in The Hindu Times</a>, “This is a direct attack on the indigenous majority. Mr. Morales is aware of this terrible situation. He resigned to prevent this violence; it did not help. “We will come back,” he wrote. And then he quoted the Andean revolutionary Tupac Katari: “Volveré y seré millones.”</p>

<p>We, the Dream Defenders, upholding our commitment to building a world free from poverty, war, violence, and environmental destruction and towards building a world with a free, flourishing, democracy, condemn this coup and its corporate supporters here in the United States.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last Thursday, Donald Trump, ordered the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian major general. This assassination is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to provoke Iran into a war. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is no secret that neoconservatives, oil barons and far right politicians like Benjamin Netanyahu have had Iran in their sights for decades. From the moment that he launched his massively Islamophobic presidential campaign in 2015, Trump was already promising to pull the United States out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (commonly referred to as the Iran Nuclear Deal). This deal was agreed to by various global leaders and fulfilled Washington’s stated main objective of preventing Iran from possessing nuclear weapons. Trump called it a “horrible one-sided deal” and began imposing more illegal unilateral sanctions on Iran. Numerous provocations have followed; from sending spy drones to Iran to blaming Iran for the Yemeni attack on the genocidal Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Trump has escalated tensions consistently since he was inaugurated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Iraqi people have already suffered from endless deaths in an endless war. <strong>The fact that the trump administration was willing to bomb a road outside an international airport in Iraq’s capital shows us the little regard that the US government has towards Iraqi lives.</strong></p>

<h3 class="is-style-epic">Trump is using war with Iran as a means to get reelected. </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imperialist aggression is enabled by the belief among some Americans that the United States must be the hegemon of the world; this is a profoundly white supremacist sentiment. The struggle against imperialism begins at home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We stand in solidarity with the Iranian and Iraqi people and their right to live in peace! We reject Trump’s imperialist aggressions and provocations! We support the Iranian people’s aspiration for freedom; freedom from poverty caused by U.S. sanctions and freedom from war, violence, and environmental destruction. We call on people of conscience to mobilize and organize the anti-war movement we need today. <strong>No war with Iran!</strong></p>
